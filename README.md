**Arrays** : Fixed size, have to declare the size at the time of defining.
OR Implied capacity 

* Can hold any type of data like premitive and non-Primitive too
* Arrays can't add elements at the end of an array due to having a fixed size 

**ArrayList** : Resizable array, Dynamically either expand or contract size automatically
* only can hold object/Reference type data
